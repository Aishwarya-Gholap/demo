        A dog is known as man’s best friend because of the way dogs are loyal and friendly to their masters. Just
        like every dog owner, children love dogs more than anything in the world. It’s not just about children,
        anyone with a pure heart simply can not deny that they love dogs, unless they are actually allergic to dogs.
        For the families that have dogs, they are not just pet animals, but a true member of their family. Through
        this essay on My Pet Dog, we will be talking about all the adorable and lovely things that dogs do.

        We found him near our house on the streets, on a rainy night and ever since that cold and scary night, he has
        been with us and has become an important part of my life. He is always the first one to greet me whenever I come
        back home from outside. He is a foodie who likes to eat pedigree and biscuits. He also eats curd rice sometimes.
        He eats three times a day with me and sleeps twice or sometimes thrice whenever he is tired after playing
        outside. He not only loves our family but also acts as a guardian to our house and helps in keeping thieves and
        bad people away from us. My pet dog is named as Raamu and I love him very much.
